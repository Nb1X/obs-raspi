# obs-arm64

Run OBS on an ARM device running Linux.

⭐ Support for Pi 4 and his hardware encoder are coming really soon! I already have a build but it doesn't support PipeWire so no Screen Capture for Wayland...

📰 If you want more info about me and the project, you should check the Wiki instead. This README is here to resume quickly the project's goal.

⚠️ If you're using Windows (Windows for ARM) on your device, an official build already exists: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases .

How to use this project:

1. Open a terminal and type all these commands in the correct order:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
`sudo apt install wget`
`wget https://github.com/Nb1X/obs-arm64/releases/download/v32.1.1/install.sh`
`chmod +x install.sh`
`./install.sh`

Then, the script will do everything for you.

2. To run OBS, run `obs`.

If you get an error "Failed to initialize video. Your GPU may not be supported, or your graphics drivers may need to be updated." it's because your GPU doesn't support OpenGL 3.3 or more. Try running OBS with this command instead: `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3 obs`.

If you get errors, issues, glitches or bugs, you can open an Issue, or go in Discussions and open a Discussion.
If nothing solves the issue, contact me on Discord: @dev_nb1x
